First week to work on the Project 20%.
I have decided that Java would be the most appropriate language for my project;
I am very familiar with Java and can write Java better than any other programming language.
So far, I've worked on some prototypes that may be potentially used in my project.
One of the prototypes is a program that uses JFrame, Graphics, ActionListener, and KeyListener.
It shows a window with a ball at the top left corner, which can be moved by using the arrow keys.
The ball however can be moved out of the window, and does not stop when the user released the arrow key.
And the second prototype is not fully functional, but I attempted to make a window(sort of like Command Prompt),
where the user can type in some command to make the computer respond to it. It doesn't work fully currently,
but the basic shape and functions are working. Next week, I am planning to work on it a little bit more,
and hopefully fix it.

I have been developing the Java programs more.
Java's graphics were very tricky to use, and very hard to design the program as I visualized at first.
I am trying to gain as much information as I could possibly get out of the Internet, and guide videos.
Recent program that I worked on, was trying to see if the physic's properties would apply in Java's program
such as the acceleration, velocity, normal force, etc. I am assuming that it would probably work, but yet I
need to figure out how to run multiple balls and properties, and to temporarly pause and resume. Next week,
I will finish that program and begin on some more prototypes.

Third week of the development of the 20% Project. I have been developing more into the prototypes, specifically
into the graphics. I added the colors to the prototypes, Color.BLACK on the background, Color.WHITE on the object(circle).
And by using the KeyReleased() method, the object now stops whenever I release the arrow keys. It works very smoothly.
I also was studying C++ language for the case where Java doesn't really work with the project that I was imagining.
C++ was an interesting language, but I will try to keep using Java because I am more fluent in Java than C++.
Next week, I will try to work and focus on Java more, by watching Youtube and studying more.

Fourth week of the development of the 20%.
I recently discovered that my prototypes are not working on a different compiler, BlueJ. (My current compiler is Eclipse Luna.)
I am concerned that my program might not work for some of the users when I published my work.
I'd have to dig Internet more to find how to prevent that.
So far I've been working on applying a physical property, acceleration onto the ball.
It seemed really easy at first, but it was very difficult to write a code for acceleration.
I, again, searched Internet and found that there were 'sensor' that I could import and use to do a lot of things.
Next week, I will dig down more and try to finalize my prototypes because next week, the second deliverable is due.
