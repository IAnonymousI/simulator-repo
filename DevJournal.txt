First week to work on the Project 20%.
I have decided that Java would be the most appropriate language for my project;
I am very familiar with Java and can write Java better than any other programming language.
So far, I've worked on some prototypes that may be potentially used in my project.
One of the prototypes is a program that uses JFrame, Graphics, ActionListener, and KeyListener.
It shows a window with a ball at the top left corner, which can be moved by using the arrow keys.
The ball however can be moved out of the window, and does not stop when the user released the arrow key.
And the second prototype is not fully functional, but I attempted to make a window(sort of like Command Prompt),
where the user can type in some command to make the computer respond to it. It doesn't work fully currently,
but the basic shape and functions are working. Next week, I am planning to work on it a little bit more,
and hopefully fix it.
